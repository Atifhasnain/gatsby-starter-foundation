The story of Brutus and Pixie begins with a seemingly unimportant comic strip. Unexpectedly, a cat and a dog develop a friendship. He is unaware of the dangerous and serious circumstances all around him.

On the other side, Brutus is a large, scarred German Shepherd. Brutus and Pixie resemble each other in a number of ways. They picked up on something. Although he is a tough and difficult military canine, he has a soft spot for Pixie and does everything in his power to shield her from the harsh truths of life. Ben had no plans to develop his experiences into a series, but because Pixie and Brutus were so beloved by his readers (and the majority of the internet), it seemed wrong not to. We really have to keep going because Ben's stories are becoming longer and new ones are coming out.
