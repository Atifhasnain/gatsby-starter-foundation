Ben Hed, an illustrator, made a cute little cartoon about 18 months ago, and he posted it to his Instagram account. It featured a cute kitten named Pixie and her foster brother, a former military dog named Brutus, and was titled "Pixie and Brutus."

Pixie and Brutus TOOK OFF and were an instant smash, as is the case with most animal-themed online sensations. Ben made the decision to turn Pixie And Brutus into a full-fledged ongoing series after this success.

Ben currently has over 2.3 million Instagram followers, many of whom admire Pixie and Brutus's exploits. Check out the adorable new Pixie & Brutus strip addition down below.
